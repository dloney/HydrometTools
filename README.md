Hydromet Tools uses several licensed components for displaying data in a tabular and graphical format. As such, you may not distribute Hydromet Tools (the Software) as part of libraries, components, or frameworks. You may not use the Software components within a development environment without purchasing the appropriate licenses from [Steema](https://www.steema.com/product/net)(Graphing Engine) and [SpreadsheetGear](http://www.spreadsheetgear.com/)(Embedded Spreadsheet). You may help us develop Hydromet Tools by compiling the source code using Open-Source libraries as stand-ins for the licensed components; a brief guide on how to do this can be found at this Wiki page.

Thanks,
Jon
